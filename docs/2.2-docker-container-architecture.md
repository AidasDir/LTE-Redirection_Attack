# Docker Container Architecture

This page provides a detailed overview of the Docker container architecture in the LTE-Redirection Attack system. We focus on the structure, build process, and responsibilities of each container in the system. For information about running the attack, see [Running the Attack](3-running-the-attack.md), and for hardware requirements, see [Hardware Requirements](2.1-hardware-requirements.md).

## Container Overview

The LTE-Redirection Attack system uses three main Docker containers that work together to implement the attack:

1. **redirect_4_2g** - Implements the fake LTE base station that redirects mobile devices to 2G
2. **osmo_egprs** - Implements the 2G/EGPRS network that devices connect to after redirection
3. **asterisk** - Handles voice call routing through a PBX

## Container Build Process

The containers are built through a multi-stage process managed by the `build.sh` script. This ensures all dependencies are properly installed and components are compiled correctly.

### redirect_4_2g Container

The `redirect_4_2g` container implements the fake LTE base station using OpenLTE with custom patches to enable redirection capability.

### osmo_egprs Container

The `osmo_egprs` container implements the 2G/EGPRS network using the Osmocom stack, providing full cellular functionality and data services.

### asterisk Container

The `asterisk` container implements a PBX for voice call handling and integrates with the Osmocom voice stack.

## Container Interaction Architecture

The containers interact through Docker networking, allowing for communication between the LTE redirector, 2G/EGPRS network, and PBX components.

## Container Component Architecture

Each container is responsible for a specific part of the attack system, and their components are built and configured as part of the container build process.

### redirect_4_2g Container Components

- OpenLTE (with custom patches)
- Telnet interface for configuration

### osmo_egprs Container Components

- Osmocom stack (HLR, MSC, BSC, SGSN, GGSN, etc.)
- Configuration files for network parameters

## Network Integration

The containers are integrated into a single Docker network, allowing for seamless communication and traffic routing between components.

## Container Configuration

Table of Key Configuration Parameters:

| Container       | Configuration Method | Key Parameters                |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| redirect_4_2g   | Telnet interface     | MCC, MNC, eNodeB ID, EARFCN   |
| osmo_egprs      | Config files         | MCC, MNC, LAC, Cell ID, ARFCN |
| asterisk        | Config files         | SIP configuration, Dial plan  |

## Container Orchestration

The container orchestration flow is managed by shell scripts that handle the building, configuration, and execution of the containers.

## Summary

The Docker container architecture of the LTE-Redirection Attack system provides a modular and configurable framework for implementing cellular network attacks. The three main containers work together to:

1. Attract mobile devices to a fake LTE network (`redirect_4_2g`)
2. Force them to connect to a fake 2G network (redirection from `redirect_4_2g` to `osmo_egprs`)
3. Intercept their data and voice traffic (`osmo_egprs` and `asterisk`)

This container-based approach allows for easy deployment, configuration, and modification of the attack system across different environments and for different mobile network operators.
