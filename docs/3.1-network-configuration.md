## Purpose and Scope

This document details the network interfaces, routing, and firewall settings required to execute the LTE redirection attack. The configuration establishes proper communication between the Docker containers, handles NAT (Network Address Translation), and enables traffic routing between the target device and the internet through our attack infrastructure. For information about operating the individual network components once configured, see [LTE Redirector Operation](3.2-lte-redirector-operation.md) and [2G Network Management](3.3-2g-network-management.md).

## Network Architecture Overview

The attack requires a properly configured network environment to:

1. Allow communication between multiple Docker containers
2. Route target device traffic through our attack infrastructure
3. Forward intercepted traffic to the internet
4. Maintain connectivity between all components

## Interface Configuration

The system requires several network interfaces to be properly configured:

1. **External Interface**: The physical network interface of the host machine that connects to the internet.
2. **Docker Bridge Interface**: The default Docker bridge network (usually 172.17.0.0/16).
3. **APN Interface**: A virtual network interface (apn0) created by the osmo_egprs container for GPRS data.

### User-Configured Interface

During setup, the user is prompted to specify:

* Which external interface to use for internet forwarding
* The IP address of this interface

This information is collected in the main `run.sh` script:

```
read -p "Forwarding Interface, device ? " interface
sudo bash srsepc_if_masq.sh interface
read -p "Forwarding Interface, ip ? " ipin
```

The provided IP address is then used to update configuration files for the 2G network components:

```
sudo sed -i -e "s/0 remote ip 127.0.0.1/0 remote ip `echo $ipin`/g" osmo_egprs/configs/osmo-bsc.cfg
sudo sed -i -e "s/listen 127.0.0.1/listen `echo $ipin`/g" osmo_egprs/configs/osmo-sgsn.cfg
```

## Routing and Network Address Translation

For proper traffic routing between all components, the system configures:

1. **IP Forwarding**: Enables the Linux kernel to forward IP packets between interfaces
2. **NAT (MASQUERADE)**: Allows traffic from internal networks to reach the internet
3. **Firewall Rules**: Permits bidirectional traffic between interfaces

### IP Forwarding Configuration

IP forwarding is enabled in multiple scripts:

```
# In forward.sh
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# In srsepc_if_masq.sh
echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 1>/dev/null
```

This essential setting allows the Linux kernel to forward packets between different network interfaces, which is necessary for routing traffic between the target device and the internet.

### NAT Configuration

Network Address Translation is set up using iptables MASQUERADE rules:

The NAT configuration allows internal networks (Docker containers and the apn0 interface) to communicate with the internet through the host's external interface.

## Specific IPTables Rules

The system sets up several iptables rules to ensure proper traffic flow:

| Rule Type | Command                                                  | Purpose                                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| NAT       | iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enp114s0 -j MASQUERADE | Allow Docker container traffic to reach the internet   |
| NAT       | iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o apn0 -j MASQUERADE     | Allow return traffic from internet to reach containers |
| Forward   | iptables -A FORWARD -i apn0 -o enp114s0 -j ACCEPT        | Accept traffic from apn0 to external interface         |
| Forward   | iptables -A FORWARD -i enp114s0 -o apn0 -j ACCEPT        | Accept return traffic from external interface to apn0  |

## Additional Network Components

### GTP Kernel Module

The GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol) kernel module is loaded to support GPRS/EGPRS data tunneling:

```
sudo modprobe gtp
```

This module is essential for the proper functioning of the GPRS data services in the 2G network.

### DNS Configuration

The system also sets up DNS resolution to ensure containers can resolve domain names:

```
echo nameserver 8.8.8.8 | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
```

This configures Google's public DNS server (8.8.8.8) as the system's DNS resolver.

## Network Configuration Workflow

The network configuration process follows this sequence:

1. User specifies the forwarding interface and its IP address
2. Configuration files are updated with the provided IP
3. Docker containers are started
4. GTP kernel module is loaded
5. IP forwarding is enabled
6. NAT and firewall rules are configured
7. DNS resolver is set up

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

If network connectivity issues occur, check:

1. IP forwarding is enabled (`sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward`)
2. NAT rules are properly set (`sudo iptables -t nat -L`)
3. Forward rules are in place (`sudo iptables -L FORWARD`)
4. The GTP module is loaded (`lsmod | grep gtp`)
5. Docker bridge network is functioning (`docker network inspect bridge`)

Note that the system modifies udev during the attack setup:

```
sudo systemctl stop udev systemd-udevd-control.socket systemd-udevd-kernel.socket
```

This may affect device detection after the attack is complete and might require restarting udev services.
