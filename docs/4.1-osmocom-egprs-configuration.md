# Osmocom EGPRS Configuration

## Purpose and Scope

This document details the configuration and architecture of the Osmocom EGPRS components used in the LTE-Redirection Attack system. These components handle the 2G/EGPRS part of the attack after mobile devices are redirected from 4G networks. This documentation focuses specifically on the configuration of BSC (Base Station Controller), SGSN (Serving GPRS Support Node), and GGSN (Gateway GPRS Support Node) within the `osmo_egprs` container.

For information about running the 2G network in practice, see [2G Network Management](3.3-2g-network-management.md).

## EGPRS Component Architecture

The Osmocom EGPRS subsystem consists of several components that work together to provide a functional 2G network. Here's how these components are organized:

## Data Flow in EGPRS Network

The following diagram illustrates how data flows through the EGPRS components:

## Base Station Controller (BSC) Configuration

The BSC is the central component managing the radio network. It controls one or more BTS (Base Transceiver Stations) and handles resource allocation, handovers, and connection to the core network.

### Network Identity Configuration

The BSC is configured with the following network identity parameters:

| Parameter            | Value | Description                   |
| -------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------- |
| Network Country Code | 208   | France                        |
| Mobile Network Code  | 15    | French operator (Free Mobile) |
| Location Area Code   | 22532 | Geographic area identifier    |
| Cell Identity        | 1801  | Unique cell identifier        |
| Base Station ID Code | 63    | Base station identity code    |

### EGPRS Configuration

The BSC is configured for EGPRS (Enhanced GPRS) operation:

```bash
bts 0
  gprs mode egprs
  gprs routing area 0
  gprs network-control-order nc0
  gprs cell bvci 2
  gprs nsei 101
```

This enables enhanced data rates for GSM evolution and configures the necessary parameters for GPRS operation. The BSC communicates with the SGSN via NS/BSSGP protocols on specified UDP ports:

```bash
  gprs nsvc 0 nsvci 0
  gprs nsvc 0 local udp port 23001
  gprs nsvc 0 remote udp port 23000
  gprs nsvc 0 remote ip 192.168.1.23
```

### Physical Channel Configuration

The BSC configures the BTS to use specific timeslots for different purposes:

| Timeslot | Configuration   | Purpose            |
| -------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| 0        | CCCH+SDCCH4     | Control channels   |
| 1        | PDCH            | Packet data        |
| 2-5      | DYNAMIC/OSMOCOM | Dynamic allocation |
| 6-7      | PDCH            | Packet data        |

This configuration allocates timeslots for both control signaling and data traffic.

## Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) Configuration

The SGSN acts as the gateway between the BSC and the GGSN, handling mobility management, session management, and authentication.

### Network Configuration

#### SGSN Configuration

- **NS Bind**: UDP port 23000, IP: 192.168.1.23
- **GTP Configuration**: Local IP: 127.0.0.1
- **GGSN Connection**: Remote IP: 192.168.1.23, GTP version 1
- **Authentication**: Policy: remote, GSUP remote-ip: 127.0.0.2, Port: 4222
- **To BSC**: UDP port 23001
- **To GGSN**
- **To HLR/VLR (Authentication)**

#### Network Service (NS) Configuration

The SGSN is configured to listen for NS connections from the BSC:

```bash
ns
  timer tns-block 3
  timer tns-block-retries 3
  timer tns-reset 3
  timer tns-reset-retries 3
  timer tns-test 30
  timer tns-alive 3
  timer tns-alive-retries 10
  bind udp local
   listen 192.168.1.23 23000
   accept-ipaccess
```

This configuration establishes the communication link with the BSC.

#### GTP and Authentication Configuration

The SGSN connects to the GGSN using GTP (GPRS Tunneling Protocol):

```bash
sgsn
  gtp state-dir ./
  gtp local-ip 127.0.0.1
  ggsn 0 remote-ip 192.168.1.23
  ggsn 0 gtp-version 1
  ggsn 0 no echo-interval
```

Authentication is configured as optional with remote policy:

```bash
  authentication optional
  auth-policy remote
  gsup remote-ip 127.0.0.2
  gsup remote-port 4222
```

This allows for flexible authentication mechanisms in the test environment.

## Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) Configuration

The GGSN connects the mobile network to external packet data networks, providing internet access to mobile subscribers.

### APN and IP Configuration

The GGSN is configured with an APN (Access Point Name) called "free" with the following settings:

![](Osmocom-EGPRS-Configuration-4.png)

#### GGSN Configuration

- **GTP Binding**: IP: 192.168.1.23
- **APN**: free
- **Type**: TUN device (apn0)
- **Support**: IPv4/IPv6 (v4v6)

**IPv4 Configuration**
- Prefix: 176.16.32.0/20
- DNS: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

**IPv6 Configuration**
- Prefix: 2001:780:44:2100::/56
- DNS: fd02:db8:3::201, 2001:4860:4860::8844

- **To Internet**

This configuration creates a TUN device `apn0` that provides internet connectivity with assigned IP ranges and DNS servers.

## Integration with Other System Components

The Osmocom EGPRS components integrate with other parts of the LTE-Redirection Attack system:

1. The LTE Redirector (`redirect_4_2g` container) forces mobile devices to downgrade from 4G to 2G
2. Mobile devices connect to the 2G network provided by Osmocom components
3. Voice calls are handled by the Asterisk PBX container
4. Data traffic is routed through the GGSN to the internet, enabling monitoring and interception

This integration allows the system to establish a man-in-the-middle position between mobile devices and both voice and data services.

## Configuration File Locations

The configuration files for the Osmocom EGPRS components are located in the `osmo_egprs/configs/` directory:

| Component | Configuration File |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| BSC       | osmo-bsc.cfg       |
| SGSN      | osmo-sgsn.cfg      |
| GGSN      | osmo-ggsn.cfg      |

These files are mounted into the `osmo_egprs` container when it is started.
