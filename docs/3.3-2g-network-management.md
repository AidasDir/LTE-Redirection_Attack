# 2G Network Management

![](2G-Network-Management-1.png)

This page documents the configuration and operation of the 2G/EGPRS network component within the LTE-Redirection Attack system. This subsystem provides the fake 2G network that target mobile devices connect to after being redirected from the fake LTE network.

## Purpose and Scope

The 2G Network Management subsystem maintains a fully functional 2G/EGPRS network that captures target devices after they've been downgraded from 4G by the LTE Redirector component. Once connected to this network, the system can intercept all voice and data traffic from these devices.

For information about the LTE component that forces devices to downgrade to 2G, see [LTE Redirector Operation](3.2-lte-redirector-operation.md).

## System Architecture

The 2G network is implemented through the `osmo_egprs` Docker container, which contains a suite of Osmocom components that together create a complete 2G/GPRS network stack.

### Component Structure

**Sources:** scripts/2G.sh, osmo_egprs/scripts/run.sh, osmo_egprs/scripts/osmo-all.sh

### Operational Flow

**Sources:** scripts/2G.sh, osmo_egprs/scripts/run.sh

## Starting the 2G Network

The 2G network component is launched using the `scripts/2G.sh` script, which starts the `osmo_egprs` Docker container:

```
sudo docker run -it --privileged -v /dev:/dev --cap-add=all --device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb \
--device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun --net host --cgroupns=host --tmpfs /tmp --tmpfs /run \
--tmpfs /run/lock -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup osmo_egprs-example bash ./run.sh
```

This command:

* Runs the container with privileged mode (`--privileged`)
* Mounts all host devices (`-v /dev:/dev`)
* Provides full capabilities (`--cap-add=all`)
* Explicitly maps USB devices for SDR access (`--device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb`)
* Sets up TUN/TAP networking (`--device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun`)
* Uses the host's network stack (`--net host`)
* Configures temporary filesystems and cgroups access

**Sources:** scripts/2G.sh

## Container Initialization Sequence

When the Docker container starts, it executes `run.sh`, which performs the following operations:

1. Runs `tun.sh` to configure network interfaces
2. Runs `runonce.sh` to initialize services
3. Starts `osmo-trx-uhd`, which interfaces with the SDR hardware to provide the radio interface

**Sources:** osmo_egprs/scripts/run.sh

## Osmocom Component Management

The 2G network consists of multiple Osmocom components, which run as systemd services within the container. The `osmo-all.sh` script provides a unified interface to manage all these services:

The script manages the following Osmocom components:

| Component          | Description                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| osmo-hlr           | Home Location Register - stores subscriber information        |
| osmo-msc           | Mobile Switching Center - handles call routing and control    |
| osmo-mgw           | Media Gateway - handles voice traffic                         |
| osmo-stp           | Signaling Transfer Point - routes signaling messages          |
| osmo-bsc           | Base Station Controller - manages radio resources             |
| osmo-ggsn          | Gateway GPRS Support Node - interfaces with external networks |
| osmo-sgsn          | Serving GPRS Support Node - manages data sessions             |
| osmo-sip-connector | Connects to SIP-based telephony services                      |
| osmo-bts           | Base Transceiver Station - handles radio transmission         |
| osmo-pcu           | Packet Control Unit - manages packet data transmission        |

## Verifying Operation

To verify that the 2G network is properly configured and operational:

1. Check that all Osmocom services are running
2. Verify that the SDR hardware is properly initialized
3. Check system logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

If the 2G network is not functioning properly, check the following:

1. **Container Launch Failures**:  
   * Ensure the host has proper USB access permissions  
   * Verify SDR hardware is connected properly
2. **Component Failures**:  
   * Check individual component status: `systemctl status osmo-bts`  
   * Review logs: `journalctl -u osmo-bsc`  
   * Restart specific components: `systemctl restart osmo-sgsn`  
   * Restart all components: `./osmo-all.sh restart`
3. **Radio Interface Issues**:  
   * Verify SDR hardware connections  
   * Check frequency configuration in Osmocom settings  
   * Ensure osmo-trx-uhd is running with proper parameters

## Integration with Attack Flow

Within the complete attack sequence:

1. The LTE Redirector component forces target devices to downgrade from 4G to 2G
2. The 2G Network Management component provides the network these devices connect to
3. Once connected, all voice and data traffic can be intercepted and analyzed
