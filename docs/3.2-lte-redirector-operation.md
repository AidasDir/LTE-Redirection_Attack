## Purpose and Scope

This document details the configuration and operation of the LTE Redirector component within the LTE-Redirection Attack system. The LTE Redirector establishes a fake LTE (4G) base station that attracts target mobile devices and forces them to downgrade to the 2G network through RRC redirection mechanisms. This page covers starting the redirector, configuring it via telnet, and understanding its technical operation.

For information about the 2G network that devices are redirected to, see [2G Network Management](3.3-2g-network-management.md). For details about the overall system architecture, see [System Architecture](4-system-architecture.md).

## LTE Redirector Overview

The LTE Redirector creates a fake LTE eNodeB (base station) that mobile devices will connect to. Once connected, it forces devices to "downgrade" to 2G networks through RRC (Radio Resource Control) connection release commands with redirection information. This component operates within the `redirect_4_2g` Docker container and exposes a telnet interface on port 30000 for configuration.

## Starting the LTE Redirector

The LTE Redirector runs in a Docker container and is started using the `redir.sh` script, which:

1. Launches the `redirect_4_2g` container
2. Sets up a Python virtual environment for the telnet scripts
3. Runs the appropriate telnet configuration script based on the selected operator
4. Opens a telnet connection to the redirector for manual configuration

### Launching the Container

The redirector is launched with the following command:

```
sudo docker run -it -d -v /dev:/dev --privileged --device /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb -v /dev:/dev redirect_4_2g-example LTE_fdd_enodeb
```

The container requires privileged access to host devices to interact with the SDR hardware.

### Operator-Specific Configuration

The system automatically runs the appropriate configuration script based on the selected mobile network operator:

| Operator | Configuration Script |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Orange   | telnet_orange.py    |
| SFR      | telnet_sfr.py       |
| Free     | telnet_free.py      |
| Bouygues | telnet_bouygues.py  |
| Lyca     | telnet_bouygues.py  |

**Sources:** scripts/redir.sh

## Telnet Configuration Interface

The LTE Redirector exposes a telnet interface on port 30000 that allows configuration of critical parameters. The Python configuration scripts automate this process, but manual configuration is also possible.

### Key Configuration Parameters

The redirector must be configured with the following essential parameters:

| Parameter            | Description                                | Example Value    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |

| mnc                  | Mobile Network Code                        | 15 (Free Mobile) |
| band                 | LTE frequency band                         | 7                |
| dl_earfcn            | Downlink EARFCN (frequency channel number) | 3350             |
| tracking_area_code   | Tracking Area Code                         | 6601             |
| rx_gain              | Receiver gain                              | 30               |
| tx_gain              | Transmitter gain                           | 80               |

Telnet Configuration Process:
- Open connection
- Send command: write n_id_cell X
- Send command: write cell_id X
- Send command: write use_cnfg_file 1
- Send command: write n_ant 2
- Send command: write mcc 208
- Send command: write mnc 15
- Send command: write band 7

## Technical Operation

The LTE Redirector works by patching the OpenLTE codebase to modify the RRC connection release message to include redirection information, forcing the device to switch to 2G (GERAN).

### RRC Redirection Mechanism

The key to the attack is the modification of the RRC connection release message to include redirect information to a specified 2G frequency:

- Device follows redirect instructions
- RRC Connection Request
- RRC Connection Setup
- RRC Connection Setup Complete
- NAS: Attach Request/Tracking Area Update
- RRC Connection Release with redirectedCarrierInfo
- Connect to specified 2G frequency (ARFCN)

**Sources:** openlte_redir_install/uhd.patch

![](LTE-Redirector-Operation-7.png)

### Implementation Details

The patch modifies the RRC connection release message to include GERAN redirection information:

1. The message is modified to include `redirectedCarrierInfo` field
2. GERAN (2G) is specified as the redirect target
3. ARFCN 514 is specified (frequency channel for 2G)
4. DCS1800 band is specified

Additionally, the MME (Mobility Management Entity) component is patched to:

1. Handle tracking area update requests with rejection
2. Force devices to disconnect from LTE and reconnect to 2G

## RadioHead Hardware Configuration

The LTE Redirector is designed to work with SDR (Software-Defined Radio) hardware. The system configures the appropriate radio parameters based on the available hardware.

Radio Hardware Configuration:
- Configure TX/RX
- Transmit Signal
- Setting stream format
- Configure TX module
- Configure RX module
- Set timestamps
- Synchronize TX/RX timing

**Sources:** openlte_redir_install/uhd.patch

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Verifying Operation

To verify the LTE Redirector is operating correctly:

1. Check that the container is running: `docker ps | grep redirect_4_2g`
2. Connect to the telnet interface: `telnet 172.17.0.2 30000`
3. Monitor for connections by entering command: `show ue_list`

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue                              | Possible Cause                  | Solution                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| No mobile devices connecting       | Incorrect MCC/MNC configuration | Verify operator settings match target devices      |
| No mobile devices connecting       | Signal strength too low         | Increase tx_gain parameter                        |
| Devices connect but don't redirect | Improper RRC configuration      | Check for error messages in telnet console         |
| SDR hardware not detected          | Device permissions              | Ensure container has proper USB access permissions |

## Conclusion

The LTE Redirector is a critical component of the LTE redirection attack. By creating a fake LTE base station and forcing devices to downgrade to 2G, it enables the subsequent interception of communications. Proper configuration of the redirector is essential for the attack to succeed, particularly with respect to operator-specific parameters.
