# Voice Call Handling

![](Voice-Call-Handling-1.png)

## Purpose and Scope

This document details the voice call handling component of the LTE-Redirection_Attack system. It explains how the system routes and processes voice calls through the Asterisk PBX (Private Branch Exchange) once a mobile device has been redirected from LTE to the 2G network. For information about the overall system architecture, see [System Architecture](4-system-architecture.md) and for details on the 2G network configuration, see [Osmocom EGPRS Configuration](4.1-osmocom-egprs-configuration.md).

## Architecture Overview

The voice call handling subsystem is implemented using Asterisk, an open-source PBX software that runs in a dedicated Docker container within the attack system. This component is responsible for:

1. Receiving voice calls from the redirected mobile devices via the 2G network
2. Processing and routing these calls to external destinations
3. Providing monitoring and logging capabilities for intercepted calls

## Asterisk Container

The Asterisk container is launched with a simple script that runs Asterisk in interactive mode with maximum verbosity for detailed monitoring and debugging.

## SIP Configuration

The Asterisk PBX is configured via the `sip.conf` file, which sets up the SIP protocol handling. The configuration establishes:

1. Basic SIP settings (ports, binding, contexts)
2. External VoIP termination through Diamondcard.us
3. A GSM peer for interfacing with the 2G network
4. A dynamic peer for test/administrative access

### General SIP Settings

The general section configures the SIP protocol behavior:

| Parameter | Value    | Description              |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| bindport  | 5060     | Standard SIP port        |
| bindaddr  | 0.0.0.0  | Listen on all interfaces |
| context   | internal | Default dialplan context |
| dtmfmode  | auto     | Automatic DTMF detection |
| qualify   | yes      | Monitor peer status      |
| nat       | yes      | NAT traversal enabled    |

**Sources:** asterisk/sip.conf

### VoIP Provider Configuration

The system is configured to use Diamondcard.us as an external VoIP provider for call termination:

```
[diamondcard]
type=peer
username=481085
fromuser=481085
secret=496891088251
host=sip2.diamondcard.us
disallow=all
allow=alaw,ulaw
fromdomain=sip2.diamondcard.us
```

This allows intercepted calls to be routed to external destinations through the internet, potentially masking the origin of the attack.

**Sources:** asterisk/sip.conf

### GSM Peer Configuration

A critical component is the GSM peer configuration, which establishes communication with the 2G network:

```
[GSM]
type=peer
host=127.0.0.1
dtmfmode=rfc2833
canreinvite=yes
disallow=all
allow=gsm
context=internal
port=5069
```

This configuration:

* Creates a peer named "GSM" that connects to the local machine (127.0.0.1)
* Uses port 5069 (non-standard SIP port) to avoid conflicts
* Enables only GSM codec for compatibility with the 2G network
* Sets the dialplan context to "internal"

**Sources:** asterisk/sip.conf

## Call Flow Process

When a mobile device makes a voice call after being redirected to the fake 2G network, the call follows this path:

The integration between the Osmocom 2G network and Asterisk is facilitated by the GSM peer configuration, which acts as a bridge between the traditional GSM voice channel and SIP-based VoIP.

## Network Configuration

For voice calls to be properly routed, the system requires appropriate network and firewall settings. The attack system uses a script to reset iptables rules, ensuring that SIP traffic can flow freely between containers and to the external internet:

These rules ensure that:

* SIP traffic (UDP/TCP port 5060) can reach the Asterisk container
* RTP media streams (typically high UDP ports) can flow for audio
* GSM voice data can be exchanged between the osmo_egprs and Asterisk containers

## Security Implications

The voice call handling component of the LTE-Redirection_Attack system has significant security implications:

1. **Call Interception**: All voice calls made through the redirected network pass through the Asterisk PBX, where they can be monitored, recorded, or manipulated.
2. **Call Metadata Collection**: The system can collect metadata about calls, including numbers dialed, call duration, and timing.
3. **Call Manipulation**: The Asterisk dialplan (not shown in the provided configuration) could potentially modify calls, inject audio, or perform other manipulations.
4. **External Routing**: The connection to an external VoIP provider allows calls to be routed to arbitrary destinations, potentially disguising the true nature of the attack.

## Conclusion

The voice call handling component built on Asterisk PBX plays a critical role in the LTE-Redirection_Attack system by processing and routing voice calls once mobile devices have been downgraded from LTE to 2G. The integration between the 2G network components and Asterisk enables complete monitoring and potential manipulation of voice communications, representing a significant privacy and security threat in the context of this attack system.
