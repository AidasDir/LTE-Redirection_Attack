# Hardware Requirements

This document details the Software Defined Radio (SDR) hardware requirements and compatibility considerations for the LTE-Redirection Attack system. It covers the specific SDR devices needed, host system requirements, and hardware configuration guidance. For information about the Docker container architecture that runs on this hardware, see [Docker Container Architecture](2.2-docker-container-architecture.md).

## SDR Hardware Requirements

The LTE-Redirection Attack system requires two separate Software Defined Radio (SDR) devices to function properly:

### Primary SDR (LTE Redirector)

The primary SDR handles the LTE base station functionality and the redirection attack:

* **Purpose**: Broadcasts a fake LTE cell and forces devices to downgrade to 2G
* **Interface**: USB 3.0 recommended for sufficient bandwidth
* **Software Component**: Used by the `redirect_4_2g` Docker container

### Secondary SDR (2G/EGPRS Base Station)

The secondary SDR implements the 2G/EGPRS network that devices connect to after redirection:

* **Purpose**: Operates a fake 2G network for the redirected devices
* **Interface**: USB 3.0 recommended for sufficient bandwidth
* **Software Component**: Used by the `osmo_egprs` Docker container
* **Note**: Must be a separate physical device from the primary SDR

### Compatible SDR Models

The system has been tested with the following SDR hardware:

| SDR Model   | Compatibility | Notes                                               |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| BladeRF-xA4 | Preferred     | Best performance and stability for this application |
| LimeSDR     | Compatible    | Adequate for both LTE and 2G components             |
| USRP B200   | Compatible    | Supported for both roles                            |
| ANTSDR      | Compatible    | Alternative to USRP B200                            |

## Host System Requirements

### System Specifications

The host computer running the LTE-Redirection Attack system must meet these requirements:

* **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 (tested platform)
* **CPU**: Minimum quad-core processor recommended
* **Memory**: Minimum 8GB RAM
* **USB Ports**: At least two USB 3.0 ports for SDR devices
* **Storage**: Minimum 20GB free space for Docker images and application data
* **Network**: Internet connection for package downloads and traffic forwarding

### Connectivity Requirements

## Hardware Selection Process

The system includes an automated hardware detection and selection mechanism as part of the installation process. This is executed through the `scripts/check_hw.sh` script when running the main `build.sh` script.

### Hardware Selection Interface

During the installation process, you will be presented with a menu-driven interface for selecting your SDR hardware:

1. The menu is launched using `kconfig-mconf builder/selected_stuff`
2. Navigate using arrow keys
3. Press 'Y' to select an option, 'N' to deselect
4. Select your SDR hardware type (BladeRF-xA4, LimeSDR, USRP B200/ANTSDR)
5. Select additional features (OpenLTE redirection, Asterisk, Osmocom network)

This selection generates a `.config` file that is used by all system components to determine which hardware drivers and configurations to use.

## Hardware Verification

Before running the application, you can verify your SDR hardware is properly connected and recognized using the following commands:

| SDR Type | Verification Command |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Any SDR  | lsusb                |
| USRP     | uhd_find_devices     |
| BladeRF  | bladeRF-cli -p       |
| LimeSDR  | LimeUtil --find      |

## Troubleshooting Hardware Issues

If the system fails to detect or properly use your SDR hardware, consider these common issues:

1. **USB Bandwidth**: Ensure SDRs are connected to separate USB controllers for sufficient bandwidth
2. **USB Power**: Some SDRs require powered USB hubs to function properly
3. **Driver Conflicts**: Ensure no conflicting SDR drivers are loaded
4. **Device Permissions**: Device permission issues can be resolved by properly triggered udev rules
5. **Hardware Compatibility**: Verify your specific SDR model is supported by checking the hardware documentation

If problems persist, check the system logs and use the hardware verification commands listed above to ensure your devices are properly recognized by the system.

## Hardware Architecture Diagram

The following diagram illustrates how the hardware components integrate with the software architecture of the system:

## Hardware Driver Components

The system includes several hardware-specific driver components that are selected and built based on your hardware selection:

1. **`builder/bladerf/`**: Contains BladeRF-specific drivers and configurations
2. **`builder/limesdr/`**: Contains LimeSDR-specific drivers and configurations
3. **`builder/usrp/`**: Contains USRP-specific drivers and configurations

These components are built automatically during the installation process based on your hardware selection in the configuration menu.
